# template files which are in the templates path
# (default: /etc/seedbank/templates)
#
# puppet_manifest   -> this tem[late is used for generating scripts in the /etc/runonce.d directort which
#                      will apply the Puppet manifests when they are selected
# pxe_default       -> the default file in the pxelinux.cfg directory, this file describes the actions
#                      which should be done when no machine specific pxelinux.cfg file is found
# rc_local          -> this template constructs a temporary initrd file which will run once and run
#                      by default the scripts in the /etc/runonce.d directory, and after it is done it
#                      will run the 'orginal' initrd script and replace itself with the 'original'
#                      initrd script
# permission_script -> from this template the 'permission script' will be generated based on
#                      'permissions' files in the overlay directory which could be generated
#                      by the 'seedbank manage command'
