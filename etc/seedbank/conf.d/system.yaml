# seedBank example configuration created by Jasper Poppe <jgpoppe@gmail.com>

# seedBank paths, be sure the tftpboot path points to the path used by the
# tftp server on a Debian or Ubuntu machine the default paths should do
# the job, so it is recommended to keep the default paths configuration

# urls for downloading resources
#
# syslinux -> tar archive of the syslinux release to use (used used by the
#             'seedbank manage --syslinux' command
urls:
  syslinux: 'http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/4.xx/syslinux-4.07.tar.gz'

# logging configuration file and logger destination
#
# configuration -> the logging configuration files
# logger        -> the default logging target which is configured
#                  in the logging configuration file
logging:
  configuration: /etc/seedbank/logging.conf
  logger: default

# default pxe/iso release selection
#
# iso -> the default ISO (release) which will be used when no release
#        has been specified with the 'seedbank iso' command
# pxe -> the default pxe netboot image (release) which will be used
#        when no release has been specified with the 'seedbank pxe' command
default_release:
  iso: debian-squeeze-amd64-mini
  pxe: debian-squeeze-amd64

# template files which are in the templates path
# (default: /etc/seedbank/templates)
#
# puppet_manifest   -> this template is used for generating scripts in the
#                      /etc/runonce.d directort which will apply the Puppet
#                      manifests when they are selected
# pxe_default       -> the default file in the pxelinux.cfg directory, this
#                      file describes the actions which should be done when no
#                      machine specific pxelinux.cfg file is found
# rc_local          -> this template constructs a temporary initrd file which
#                      will only run once and it will run by default all
#                      scripts located in the /etc/runonce.d directory. When
#                      it is done it will finally run the 'orginal' initrd
#                      script and replace it self with this initrd script
# permission_script -> from this template the 'permission script' will be
#                      generated based on 'permissions' files in the overlay
#                      directory which could be generated by the 'seedbank
#                      manage command'
templates:
  puppet_manifest: puppet_manifest
  pxe_default: pxe_default
  rc_local: rc.local
